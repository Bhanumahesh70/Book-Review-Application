## Project Description

Users can evaluate and discuss their favorite books on the Book Evaluate Application, a web-based platform. Customers are able to register, safely log in, and provide reviews for books they've read. Users can also add a book and review it. Users can modify the book's content only if it was added by them. They can search for particular books and go through reviews that have already been written by other users. The aim of the app is to create a lively community of book lovers who exchange ideas and recommendations.

## Development Environment

The application is developed using Node.js and Express.js, making it scalable and quick. A contemporary computer running the most recent version of Windows, macOS, or Linux makes up the development environment. The main editor used is Visual Studio Code, which has the necessary extensions for Node.js programming, and the version of Node.js utilized is 16.4.5. Other technologies used include Git for version control and Postman for API testing.

## Installation/Running Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using the command `git clone https://github.com/Bhanumahesh70/ITMD542_FinalProject`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt.
3. Install project dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables.
5. Start the application using the command `npm start`.
6. Access the application through a web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Findings and Conclusions

Using Passport.js for user authentication, express-session for secure session management, and Mongoose for MongoDB interactions to guarantee data integrity were some of the difficulties faced throughout development. Nevertheless, these difficulties were effectively solved with careful testing and debugging. Now that the program is operating successfully, users may sign up, log in, post reviews, and interact with other community members efficiently. To give readers a visual picture of the functionality of the project, screenshots of the application's user interface and other features are provided in the documentation.
